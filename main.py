Working Theory for event loops. Adding the decorator makes the function name significant, and causes it to be called
whenever the event corresponding to the name is seen by the program.
Still no clue what 'await' is for, or how to send a message without using it, which would be handy for sending messages
from functions, and compacting the event loop, as well as implementing other features.
(maybe that could be bodged with message editing lol. except idk how to do that yet either)
Could not work it out by looking through autocomplete values that appear when trying to create my own loop.
